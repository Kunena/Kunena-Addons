/**
 * WARNING: It is better to install the build tool PHING through
 * PEAR.  PEAR auto creates some environment variables
 * to run the build tool using the $ phing command versus
 * having to do $ php build.php command.  Composer also distributes
 * extra needed dependencies to be able to run. We have provided a
 * composer file as an alternate solution to be able to install
 * and use the build tool for those that are familiar composer,
 * however it is recommended to use the PEAR package instead.
